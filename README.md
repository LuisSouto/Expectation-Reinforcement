# Expectation-Reinforcement
Implementation in C++ of the Expectation Reinforcement algorithm.

In order to compile the code you need the g++ compiler, or change the makefile and use a compiler of your choice.

Inside the C++ folder, run the makefile to compile the ER code. Then, execute sh build.sh on a linux terminal (or the corresponding syntax in another operating system) and, after successful compilation, ./BRUP_ER to execute the code.

The results of BRUP_ER.cpp will go to the results folder, which can then be analyzed using the analyze_results.py Python script.
